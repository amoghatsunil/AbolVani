<p align="center">
I AM THE VOICE OF VOICELESS; <br>
THROUGH ME THE DUMB SHALL SPEAK, <br>
TILL THE DEAF WORLD'S EARS BE <br>
MADE TO HEAR. <br>
THE WRONGS OF WORDLESS WEAK. <br>
AND I AM MY BROTHERS KEEPER, AND <br>
I WILL FIGHT HIS FIGHTS; <br>
AND SPEAK THE WORDS FOR BEAST AND BIRD </p>

## INSPIRATION

With the rapid evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the fear of contagion pushed countries around the world to implement measures such as national quarantines and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But amid the fear of the COVID-19 contagion, people with disabilties find it difficult to communicate. 
Also, video calling has always been a probelm to the disabled. Providing them ease with video calling during pandemic or no pandemic was our inspiration to go through the thought process and come up with a solution! 
The gift of voice has been one of the greatest gifts of god, but we cannot ignore the fact that some are deprived of it. They use sign languages as the means of communication but most of us dont understand the exact meaning of a gesture.
